# Seurat-scRNAseq-Transcriptomics
 Analysis of example scRNAseq datasets from satijalab

Seurat is an R package frequently employed for the QC, analysis, and exploration of single-cell RNA-seq data.

Here, I have explored several example datasets to gain familiarity analysing high dimensional transcriptomics data. 

This provided experience working with these types of data and allowed me to support the subsequent SenPred ML classification project. 

# Seurat-Example-PBMC
Analysed pbmc3k dataset with Seurat.
Identified cell types, visualized clusters, and detected differential gene expression.

# Seurat-Example-Integration
Explored integration techniques in Seurat using data from human PBMCs from two conditions, interferon-stimulated and control cells (ifnb)

## Methods
- Quality control
- Normalization
- Dimensionality reduction
- Clustering
- Visualization
- Differential expression analysis
- Integration

## Outputs
- Identified cell clusters representing different types.
- Visualized clusters and marker genes.
- Detected differential gene expression.
- - Integrated multiple datasets.
