# Seurat-scRNAseq-Transcriptomics
 Analysis of example scRNAseq datasets from satijalab

Seurat is an R package frequently employed for the QC, analysis, and exploration of single-cell RNA-seq data.

Here, I have explored several example datasets to gain familiarity analysing high dimensional transcriptomics data. 

This provided expereince working with these types of data and allowed me to support the subsequent SenPred ML classification project.
